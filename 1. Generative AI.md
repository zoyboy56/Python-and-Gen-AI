*AI*



     *--Natural language processing*

     *--Image recognition*

     *-- TTS , STT -- Test to speech . Speech to text*

	



*Generative AI - Generating content using AI*



*Chat GPT (Generative Pre Trained Text Transformer) - it is a kind of model with trained knowledge/data*

*Question(Prompt) -- Chat GPT --Search The Knowledge (trained with some knowledge) -- Get The Response form the knowledge --formats the answer --readable output*



*AI Terms :*



*Prompt --> Model (Trained Corpus) --Generative Pre Trained Text Transformers(GPT) --Output (response)*															





*\*-- Trained corpus means it got trained with a lot of data, All the data is stored in Model.*                                                  

      *--corpus means a collection of written or spoken text.*

      *-- it is also called language model because this is getting trained on a language* 



	*Language Model, if is based on linguistics ( only text in any language, i.e. no photo/video anything.) is called --Large Language Model (LLMs), for image/video Large Vision Models (LVMs)-image generation*

	  

	*Large Language Models are the foundation pillars of AI.*

*LLM (Text to Text)- claude.ai*

*LVM (Text to Image)-ideogram.ai*

*Text to Music - suno.com*

*Text to video - app.rumwayml.com*



*\*-- Transformers is responsible for searching this data(Prompt) and getting the data out(Answers/response), e.g. - Chat GPT,*

    *-- current GPT version is GPT 4o, GPT 4mini   --- fourth generation.*





*Google :*



*when you type a search query --PageRank algorithm (search algorithm) --breaks our search query into words -- do a similarity search -- similarity score ( 100% to 0% match) --rank the links and display it to us.*
